# music_piano_deep_learning
the project can be used to generate piano tune.
# the music train model file
it contains all the code required to train the keras model
# the music generation file
it contains all the code required to get the output
# weights file added are not working quite well as my computer is not working properly 
# model trained only for 3 epochs and then interrupted causing error in music train model.ipynb
try to train your own model to get good outputs
# dependencies used
   1. keras
   2. numpy 
   3. music21
   4. pickle
   5. glob
# to get output run 
music generation.ipynb
# layers used 
   1. LSTM
   2. dropout
   3. dense
# type of modeling 
sequential
